# To Do List

- Rspec tests: king, queen, pawn (others should work if these work correctly)

- Game: 'check', 'checkmate' state

- Looking into future (clone board): Can't move self into check or checkmate, can't castle through check, during check move must result in checkless board

- Game: castle handling and pawn promotion

- Game: checkmate and stalemate end conditions

- GUI: mouse-driven or keyboard?  stick with curses?

- Trim piece.rb

Rubocop cleanup:

- Pawn.rb - complexity #41

- Piece.rb - length
